# Tic-Tac-Toe


In our main program we follow the steps given below:

1.First of all, define the tk window with the Tk() as the root variable.
2.Then we create the title of the window.
3.Next, we define a variable to store the playable character(say, ‘O’ and ‘X’).
4.Then we define a list to store all the buttons and place them in the window.
5.Finally, we display a label saying the character which has to be played next.
6.We end by a window.mainloop() function to keep events on the main window active and all other widgets interactive.
